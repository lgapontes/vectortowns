# Translating hand in hand

Translation project for the game vectortowns.

Stakeholders: the whole community of players :)

How to start?
- Access the "translation" folder and be happy ...

Rules:
- Someone translates a phrase. In this case, create a branch from the pre-master and make its change in it. The direct change in the master or pre-master is not allowed;
- Someone else checks. Use the branch that the first guy created;
- If the two previous steps are done, a third person approves. In this case, commit the word "done" and merge the translation branch with the pre-master.
