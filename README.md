# Translating hand in hand

Translation project for the game vectortowns.

Stakeholders: the whole community of players :)

How to start?
- Access the "translation" folder and be happy ...

Rules:
- Someone translates a phrase.
- Someone else checks.
- If the two previous steps are done, a third person approves (in this case, commit with the word "done").
